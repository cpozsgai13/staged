Angular front end prototype securely connecting to Java Spring backend

This test prototype is designed to demonstrate some basic Angular capability through a login screen and
the ability to load images onto a homepage.

The front end connects to a backend service using https, and uses a self signed certificate to
establish secure communications.

Also, the environment is configured to bypass the server using json-server.  This is a fast way
to implement features on the front end and defer the backend development until later.
There is a start script for Windows side in the root directory.
